TASK_4_COMPLETE___Traffic Accident Data Analysis & Visualization 🚦📊 This project examines traffic accident patterns to uncover relationships between road conditions, weather, and time of day. Using data analysis and visualization techniques, it identifies accident hotspots and key contributing factors to improve road safety planning
**Traffic Accident Analysis and Visualization 🚦📊**

In this project, I analyzed traffic accident data to find patterns based on weather, road conditions, and time of day. The aim was to spot accident hotspots and understand the causes to help improve road safety.

🔹 **What I did:**

* Cleaned the data and fixed missing values
* Explored patterns using charts and graphs
* Visualized accident hotspots with heatmaps and plots
* Tried machine learning to predict accident risks

🔍 **Key Insights:**

* Accidents increase during rush hours and bad weather
* Bad road conditions lead to more severe accidents
* Some intersections have frequent accidents — need safety upgrades

🛠 **Tools Used:**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
